  help: "*Hello!* I'm a bot that gives you a quick access to [Andoid Theming Vriables Glossary](http://telegra.ph/Android-Theme-Variables-Guide-05-08).\n\nSend me a variable name, and I'll reply you with the variable description and its picture, e. g. try sending `windowBackgroundWhite`, or `wIND ow___backGRou n d W hIte`, I'll understand. You can also add a language prefix to get a description in a specific langauge (if it's supported), e. g. send me `ru graySection` and I'll reply you in Russian. (If the language is not supported, that prefix will be determinated as a variable's name piece)\n\nYou can also use me inlinely the same way, e. g. type `@atthemeglossarybot [<language>] <variable>`. I'll also try to predict description of what variable you want, so you don't have to write that long name fully. If you didn't type anything but language, I'll suggest you sections of the glossary. Unfortunately, I can't send images this way :(.\n\nYou can also add me in groups, and its members will be able to use the `/variable [<language>] <variable>` command to get descriptions of variables and their screeshots.\n\nHope you enjoy this bot, send your feedback to @snejugal.",
